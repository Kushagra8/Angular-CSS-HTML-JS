How to use AngularJS with HTML & CSS (plus JavaScript)

Description of the concepts used:

Angular Directives
Angular directives extend HTML elements with custom behavior and interactivity. They enable dynamic rendering, conditional display, and response to user actions. Common directives include ngIf, ngFor, and ngModel.

Filters
Filters in Angular transform data for display, allowing you to format dates, numbers, and text. They help create a user-friendly view by modifying data presentation before rendering.

Attributes
Custom attributes in Angular enhance HTML elements with additional data or functionality. They're used for data binding, event handling, and extending element behavior, often for interacting with external libraries.

Inheritance
In Angular, inheritance is crucial for building modular components and services. Components can inherit properties and methods from parent components, promoting code reuse and extensibility. Class inheritance is also supported for services and TypeScript classes, enabling efficient code building and extension.
